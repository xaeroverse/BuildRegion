In Minecraft, having to go back and fix blocks that you accidentally placed or
destroyed is time-consuming and annoying. BuildRegion is a user interface
enhancement mod, designed to help you avoid these little accidents.

BuildRegion can also help you plan structures, giving you a dynamic blueprint
right there in the world.

BuildRegion is *not* an auto-build tool. It will only prevent you from
misclicking; it will not click for you. It's all client-side, meaning you can
use this on multi-player without the server having to run a special plugin.

See the [current minecraftforums.net thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/t/2189861)
for screenshots and a demo video.

## Installation

First of all, make sure that
[LibShapeDraw](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/t/2188255) is
installed as it is a base requirement. You'll also need
[LiteLoader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1868280-).

Next, download the litemod and move it to the `mods` subdirectory.  This
subdirectory can be found in your
[Minecraft directory](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/.minecraft).

## Usage

To get started, hold `control` on your keyboard and `right-click` your mouse.
This will make a grid appear in front of you. As long as the grid is active,
you can only build inside that region. Use `control-left-click` to remove the
build region.

You can easily redefine the region: just move around or face a different
direction, then `control-right-click` again. You can also move the region
around using `[`, `]`, and the arrow keys.

Press `B` to change how the build region works:

 *   *Blue (default)*: you can only place or destroy blocks *inside* the grid.
 *   *Red*: you can only place or destroy blocks *outside* the grid.
 *   *Green and white*: the grid is for *display* only; it won't affect block
     placement.

Finally, press `shift-B` or `control-middle-click` to open up a GUI window to
help you define the region. Most of the things that you can do in the GUI are
already covered by a keyboard or mouse shortcut, listed above. The GUI is
intended as an alternate way to set up your region -- use whichever method you
prefer! Even if the GUI is open, you can still use keyboard/mouse shortcuts, and
you can adjust the camera by moving the mouse while holding `right-click`.

Note: if you're using a Mac, use `command (âŒ˜)` instead of `control`.
